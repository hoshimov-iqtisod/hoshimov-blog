Quoted from Alexander Auzan, Dean of Economics Faculty at Moscow State University.

*"Unlike economists and political scientists, we can say that the country is authoritarian or democratic even though it is in the constitution. You don't even have to look at the electoral procedures.*

*If we know how taxes are formed, we will be able to identify them immediately.*

*This is because taxes are imposed, how much taxes are imposed, taxes are for the production of public goods, for the regulation of rules, for the production of health, education and so on. Or are these taxes the rent of the government and the means to support the people in their care? These are determined by calculations, formulas and acceptable levels."*
