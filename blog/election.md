In my district, I voted for a 96-year-old graduate of the Diplomatic University. In the City Council, I voted for the Executive Director of the Development Strategy Center. I hope the candidates who vote will win.

In addition, I am in favor of legalizing who is voting openly. I support legalization of exit polls. And I stand for the silence ahead of the parliamentary elections, just like the presidential election. If it was legal to speak proudly of who you voted for, I think everyone would win. The current legislation is an artifact of the past, since previously only media could have been propagandized, but now everyone can write to thousands of people in one letter. So it's impossible to control. This creates a legal nihilism. In addition, if it is legal for a voter to vote for, for example, his 100 friends, I think why this practice should be banned.

My dream is for our country to be free and democratic.
