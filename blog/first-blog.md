When Benjamin Franklin was leaving the constitution, a man asked:

* Mr. What is going to happen to our country, the monarchy, or the republic?
* Republic, if you can keep it.

Franklin says that it is up to the citizens to protect the republic, that is, to organize democracy and freedom, and most importantly, to save. I think this is a very profound idea.

Last time I heard this on March 3, it was said by Adam Schiff during the impeachment in the Senate, former US Congress Speaker Pelosi, and recently named Nil Gorsuch himself, a recently elected US Supreme Court judge. Indeed, freedom is not the status quo. It should also be remembered here by Acemoglu and Robinson's new book (Narrow Corridor).

All in all, Franklin was a very smart person, one of his best words:

“Only good people can be free. There is an increasing need for farmers in corrupt and cruel nations. ”
